### Hey. ðŸ‘‹

I'm FranÃ§ois, 24, based in Lyon ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·.
I do software engineering for a living, currently in the cybersecurity domain.

### Tech I work with:
- I'm most proficient in **C++**, but I also know my way around **C#** and **Python**.
- **Desktop development** is the domain I'm the most acquainted with, and I'm comfortable with the **Win32 API** and associated frameworks (COM, MFC, ATL, etc).
- I'm also somewhat familiar with **Qt** (C++) and **Windows Forms** (C#).
- I love to hate **CMake** and I strive to achieve code that is cross-platform, robust and elegantly organized in a neat architecture.
- I can do backend web development, but I suck at frontend so don't even bother to ask me (for your own sake, that is).

### Stuff that I wrote:
<sub>(**_bold italic font_** = actively worked on)</sub>
- [MidiVR](https://github.com/deqyra/MidiVR) (2017): a generic MIDI controller in VR, made with Unity (C#).
