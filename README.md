### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm FranÃ§ois, 27, based in Lyon, France.
I do software engineering for a living, currently in the cybersecurity domain.

### About me:
- Mostly a **C++** nerd, but I also know my way around **C#** and **Python**
- I love to hate **CMake** and I strive to achieve code that is cross-platform, robust and reads nice
- Due to prolonged exposure to **desktop development** on **Windows**, I developped an unfortunate Stockholm syndrome for the **Win32 API** and the dinosaur-grade technologies that orbit it
- I like to have online ~~arguments~~ discussions about C++ with strangers
- I use Arch btw
